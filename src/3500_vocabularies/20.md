# 20. A Unique Theme Park <ContentToggle>独一无二的主题公园</ContentToggle>

As soon as our shuttle got close to the theme park by the freeway, everyone came to life and put on cloth sneakers in advance for an outing. Our translator paid for the admission, and we started enjoying the various attractions in the sunlight.

According to the travel brochure, this unique park is famous for its well preserved minority culture. We experienced many deeds of the early settlers, such as swinging across rivers, hunting creatures in the jungle, or taking part in swords fighting tournaments.

This park is also famous for its wooden souvenirs. Whichever we bought in the central shop was made of wood, and wherever we went we could see minority carpenters working. They made wooden tools, wooden cartoon figures, wooden athletic products and so on. They even built a huge wooden engine with a length of 20 metres, which was modeled after a real one.

This theme park is really a fantasy amusement park. No wonder it has become the brand of local tourism.

我们走高速公路的来往穿梭巴士一接近主题公园，大家都活跃了起来，并且提前穿上了布鞋，做好这趟外出旅游的准备。翻译付了入场费后，我们就开始在阳光下欣赏各种各样吸引人的东西。

根据旅行手册的介绍，这个独一无二的公园因其得到良好保护的少数民族文化而闻名。我们体验了许多早期定居者所做的事，如荡过河啦，在丛林中猎杀动物啦，或者参加剑术比赛啦等等。

这个公园还因为它的木制纪念品而闻名，我们在中心商场购买的任何一件物品，都是用木头制作的，无论我们走到哪里，都可以看见少数民族的木匠们在忙碌。他们制作的有木制工具、木制的卡通人物、木制的运动用的产品，等等等等。他们甚至还根据一台真实发动机仿造了一台长度有20米的木制发动机。

这个主题公园真是个充满幻想的娱乐公园，怪不得它成为当地旅游业的一个品牌。
