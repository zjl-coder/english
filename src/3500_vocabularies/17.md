# 17. A New Farming Way <ContentToggle>新的耕种方式</ContentToggle>

Tuan was a farmer in Vietnam. For decades, he had been struggling to rid his family of hunger. However, it always confused him how to expand the output of his crops. This disturbing problem led to his regretting being a farmer. He would rather have chosen another job.

One day, when skimming through a newspaper, Tuan read a comment on Yuan Longping. He underlined Yuan's nationality and occupation, and then focused on his discovery and the statistics of his research. He found the knowledge Yuan circulated very practical. Therefore, he made a summary and began to build up a new farming method. He planted super grain of rich nutrition and equipped himself to keep his crops roots free from bacteria and pests. He also enriched minerals in the soil while reducing chemical fertilizers. Though it cost him more time and freedom, he was full of hope.

The next year, Tuan was sunburnt but satisfied with his production very much. Thanks to Yuan Longping, he not only won the battle against hunger, but he could also export his crops abroad.

俊是一名越南的农民，几十年来，他都一直在努力使家人摆脱饥饿。然而，如何扩大他的农作物产量这一问题却一直在困扰着他。这个恼人的问题导致了他后悔当一名农民，而宁愿自己当初选择其它的工作。

一天，俊在浏览报纸的时候，读到一篇关于袁隆平的评论。他在袁的国籍和职业下面划了线，然后将焦点集中在他的发现和研究数据上。他发现袁传播的知识非常实用，因此，他做了摘要，并开始建立一种新的耕作方式。他种植营养丰富的超级谷物，添置设备以使作物的根部免受细菌害虫的伤害；他还增加土壤所含的矿物质，同时减少化学肥料的使用。尽管耗费了他更多的时间和自由，他却充满着希望。

第二年，俊被晒黑了，但是却对自己的生产非常满意。多亏了袁隆平，他不仅赢得了对抗饥饿的战斗，而且还将自己的作物出口到国外呢。
