# A Hard Trip <ContentToggle>⼀次⾟苦的旅⾏</ContentToggle>

My sister was fond of traveling. Ever since graduating, she had been determined to
organize a trip to an old temple. Since transporting fare was expensive, she decided
to use a bicycle to cycle there not caring about the disadvantages. Her stubborn
attitude was always her shortcoming. Once she made up her mind to do something,
no one could persuade her to change her mind. Finally, we gave in as usual though
we preferred to take a train. After we prepared everything, including the schedule,
reliable weather forecast and the insurance, we began our trip.  

Our journey was along a river flowing from a high altitude. Our pace was slow
because the river frequently had many sharp bends through deep valleys, where
the water seemed to boil. Just as I recorded in my journal, it was really a hard
journey. But we also enjoyed great views. One night, I put my head on my pillow-a
parcel of wool coats, and lay beneath the stars. When the flame in front of our cave
went out at midnight, I found the sky so beautiful!

我的妹妹很喜欢旅⾏。⾃从毕业以来，她就下定决⼼要组织⼀次往⼀座古庙的旅⾏。因为交通费⽤昂贵，她决定骑⾃⾏车去，毫不担⼼其中的不利情况。顽固的态度⼀直都是她的缺点，⼀旦她下定决⼼要做的事，就没有⼈能说服她改变主意。最后，我们像往常⼀样让步，尽管我们更喜欢乘⽕车去。我们准备好了所有东西，包括时间表、可靠的天⽓预报，还有保险，就开始了旅程。

我们的旅程沿着⼀条从⾼海拔处流下来的河流前⾏。但我们的步伐很慢，因为当流经深深的峡⾕时，这条河流急转弯很多，急湍的河⽔都似乎沸腾起来。正如我在旅⾏⽇志⾥记录的那样，这真是⼀次艰苦的旅⾏。但是我们也欣赏到了美丽的景⾊。⼀天晚上，我把头枕在⼀包⽺⽑⾐服做的枕头上，躺在星空下，当岩洞前的⽕焰在午夜熄灭时，我发现夜空是如此的美丽！
