# 12. Balanced Diet <ContentToggle>平衡膳食</ContentToggle>

Wang Peng earned his living by running a barbecue restaurant, which served delicious bacon, fried chicken breast and mutton roasted with pepper and garlic. But his food and discount attracted fewer and fewer customers. Finally, he was in debt. Yong Hui's slimming restaurant served fresh peas, carrots, eggplants, and raw cucumbers with vinegar. As the hostess, she said fibres benefited customers' digestion the most. In order not to let Yong Hui get away with telling lies, Wang Peng spied on Yong Hui despite her glare.

But he was surprised. Curiosity drove Wang Peng to check Yong Hui's menu. He found that her dishes had too few calories, while his food contained too much fat. "Your menu has shortcomings. Your customers will become weak too easily, while the fat in your food will make them put on weight," said a nutritionist. "You ought to combine the two menus and provide a balanced diet."

Before long, Wang Peng won his customers back.

王鹏经营一家烧烤餐厅来谋生，他的餐厅供应美味的腊肉、油炸的鸡胸，还有用辣椒和大蒜一起烤制的羊肉。但是，他的食物和折扣吸引的顾客越来越少，最后他负债累累。永慧的减肥餐厅供应的是新鲜的豌豆、胡萝卜、茄子和醋腌的生黄瓜。作为老板娘（女主人），她总是说食物纤维才最有利于顾客的消化。为了不让永慧说了谎不受惩罚，王鹏不顾她的怒视，前去探查个究竟。

但让他惊奇的是，好奇心驱使王鹏去查看永慧的菜单。他发现她的菜肴热量太少，而他的食物含有太多脂肪。“你的菜单有缺点。你的顾客会很容易变得虚弱，而你食物中的脂肪会让他们发胖，”一位营养学家说。“你应该把两份菜单结合起来，给顾客提供平衡的膳食。”

不久，王鹏就赢回了他的顾客。
