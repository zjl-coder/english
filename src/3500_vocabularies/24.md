# 24. An Amateur Journalist <ContentToggle>业余记者</ContentToggle>

Jane is a housewife, but delighted to work as an amateur journalist. It is a dilemma for her to rush between family and work, and it is also unusual for the News Department to depend on an amateur to cover crimes. But Jane is really gifted. It is admirable that she is seldom accused of making mistakes. And, eager to become more professional, she concentrates on her job and updates herself now and then.

Once she is informed of a new case, her normal working process is as follows: first, she makes appointments with guilty people for interviews. So as to acquire accurate stories, she usually demands to record what they say. Meanwhile, a technically good colleague will assist her in taking photographs. Second, she assesses whether they are deliberately hiding the truth.

If she is skeptical about their words, she will look into the case herself. Third, she writes thorough stories ahead of the deadline and submits it to the senior chief editor, who polishes and approves every section. Finally, her stories will be published in different editions of their magazine.

简是一名家庭主妇，但却非常乐意做一名业余记者。在家和工作之间奔波总是使她左右为难，而且对于新闻部来说，依靠一名业余人员来报道罪案也是不同寻常的，但是简真的很有天赋，让人钦佩的是她极少因为犯错而受到责备。因为渴望做得更加专业，她全神贯注于工作，且时不时地就提升自身的业务水平。

一旦接到新案子的通知，她通常的工作程序如下：首先，她和有罪的人约了作采访。为了获得准确的新闻，她通常要求做录音，同时，一位技术上好的同事会协助她拍照；接着，她对受采访的人是否有故意隐瞒真相作出评估。

如果她怀疑他们的话，就会亲自调查案件；然后，她在截稿期限前写出详尽的报道，呈交给高级主编，由他对每个部分做润色和批准；最后，她的新闻就发表在杂志的各个版本中了。
