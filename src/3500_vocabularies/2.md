# Different Countries Have Different Kinds of Englishes <ContentToggle>不同的国家有不同的英语</ContentToggle>

Voyages of people from England play an important part in spreading the English language. At present, English is frequently spoken as an official or common language in many countries, such as America, Singapore, Malaysia and some African countries. All based on British English, the English spoken in these countries can be well understood by native English speakers. But actually, these Englishes have been gradually changing in accents, spellings, expressions and the usage of vocabulary.  

Because of this fact, you can make use of the differences to tell which country the
foreigners of your block are from. For example, if a boss fluently commands his
driver, "Come up straight to my apartment by elevator and take some gas for my
trucks and cabs", instead of requesting, "Please come to my flat by lift and take
some petrol for my lorries and taxis", you can recognize his American identity, while
the latter suggests that he is British.

英国⼈的航海在英语的传播中扮演了重要的⾓⾊。⽬前，英语在许多国家被作为官⽅语⾔或通⽤语⾔频繁地使⽤，例如美国、新加坡、马来西亚和⼀些⾲洲的国家。这些国家的英语都以英式英语为基础，能很好地为以英语为本族语的⼈所理解。但是实际上，这些英语在⼜⾳、拼写、表达和词汇的使⽤⽅⾯都在逐渐变化

因为这⼀情况的存在，你就可以利⽤这些英语之间的区别说出你们街区的外国⼈是哪个国家来的了。例如，如果有个⽼板流利地命令他的司机：“直接搭电梯到我公寓上来拿卡车和出租车的汽油”，⽽不是要求说，“请搭电梯到我公寓上来拿卡车和出租车的汽油”，你就可以轻易地辨认出他的美国⼈⾝份，⽽后者却暗⽰着那是⼀位英国⼈。
