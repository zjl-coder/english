# 29. Refresh Our Environment <ContentToggle>恢复环境生机</ContentToggle>

As the director stated on behalf of his researching group, the data of this graph makes a clear presentation of the future environmental tendency. On one hand, quantity of fuel keeps on decreasing by 9% per year while the growth of a wide range of pollution has been a global trend. On the other hand, the mildly but steadily going up of the average temperature is resulting in catastrophes like widespread floods.

Without disagreement, they subscribe to the view that it is humans' existence and their randomly consuming energy that result in this phenomenon.

Many people have a commitment that developing nuclear power or energy from outer space will stop bad consequences coming about. However, scientists and educators are opposed to this view even if our needs may be met on the whole.

They tend to advocate refreshing our circumstances by saving energy and recycling waste. It is suggested that we use energy-saving appliances such as electrical motors, microwaves and so on and not be casual about little things like recycling a can. So please glance around and see what you can do. So long as everybody makes contribution, we will not have to put up with this problem anymore.

正如那位主任代表他的研究小组所说明的那样，这张图表的数据清楚地描述了未来环境的趋势：一方面，燃料的数量以每年9%的速度持续减少，同时，大范围污染的增长已经成为一种全球趋势；另一方面，平均气温轻微却稳定地升高正在造成像广泛的洪涝那样的灾难。

无不同意地，他们一致赞成是人类的存在和任意地消耗能源才造成了这一现象。

许多人都信奉开发核能和外太空能源会防止糟糕的后果发生的理论，然而，即使这样可以基本上满足我们的需要，科学家和教育家们仍然反对这一观点。

他们更倾向于拥护用节省能源和回收废料的方法恢复环境生机，并建议我们要使用节省能源的器具，如电力发动机、微波炉等，还建议我们不要对如回收罐子这种小事漫不经心。因此，看看你身边是否有你能做的事，只要每个人都作出贡献，我们就不必再忍受这个问题的困扰了。
