# Fall in Love with English <ContentToggle>爱上英语</ContentToggle>

Hiding behind the loose dusty curtain, a teenager packed up his overcoat into the suitcase. He planned to leave home at dusk though there was thunder and lightning outdoors. He had got to do this because he was tired of his parents' nagging about his English study and did not want to go through it any longer. He couldn't get along well with English and disliked joining in English classes because he thought his teacher ignored him on purpose.  


As a result, his score in each exam never added up to over 60. His partner was concerned about him very much. She understood exactly what he was suffering from, but entirely disagreed with his idea. In order to calm him down and settle his problem, she talked with him face to face and swapped a series of learning tips with him. The items she set down helped him find the highway to studying English well.   

The teenager was grateful and got great power from his friend's words. Now, he has
recovered from being upset and has fallen in love with English.
