# 18. Chaplin - A Great Master of Humour <ContentToggle>幽默大师卓别林</ContentToggle>

Chaplin was an extraordinary performer who starred in and directed many outstanding comedies. Few were bored watching his moustache, his gestures or his entertaining reactions when chased by detectives. Being drunk, sliding on a banana skin or whispering his own failures to nobody, he made us feel more content with our life without any verbal explanation. His particular sense of humor has astonished everybody throughout the world up to now.

In a small budget film, he played a badly-off and homeless person wearing worn-out shoes and messy clothes. On one occasion, he was trapped by a snowstorm in a vast mountainous area. Though he overcame many difficulties, he wasn't fortunate enough. With all the porridge eaten up, he picked out a shoe and boiled it to eat. He cut off the leather bottom and chewed it like a pancake. According to an actress, his acting was so convincing and amusing that everybody couldn't help bursting into laughter.

卓别林是一名非凡的演员，他主演并导演了多部杰出的喜剧。看见他可笑的小胡子、滑稽的手势动作，还有面对警探的追捕时有趣的反应，很少有人会觉得厌烦。喝醉酒啦，踩到香蕉皮滑倒啦，或者自言自语（低语）自己的糗事啦，他无需任何语言解释的表演总是使我们对自己的生活感到更加满意。他独特的幽默感直到现在依然使世界各地的人们都感到惊讶。

在一部小预算的电影里，他穿着磨破的鞋子和脏兮兮的衣服，扮演了一名贫穷又无家可归的人。在一幕场景中，他被一场暴风雪困在一片多山的区域里。尽管他克服了许多困难，但是他还是运气不好。粥都吃完了，他只好挑出一只鞋子煮来吃。他切下皮革的鞋底，像烙饼一样地咀嚼起来。据一名女演员所说，他的表演是如此地令人信服而又逗人发笑，以致在场的所有人都忍不住大笑起来。
