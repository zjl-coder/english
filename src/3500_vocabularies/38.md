# 38. Strange Patent Applications <ContentToggle>奇怪的专利申请</ContentToggle>

I set about working in the current Patent Office after resigning from the court personnel. Competent and dynamic, I never feel passive while diving into the identifications of whether applications are valid and practical according to the new version of the criteria.

With the expectation of distinguishing their own importance, some people leave the beaten track and file strange products with us now and then, for example, lantern that can be attached on your forehead, cubic walnuts, refrigerator made of straw and glue, perfume that nobody can bear to smell, and so on.

Once, a man made a triangle helicopter out of stainless wires and string. He called us up and merrily claimed it was stable and convenient to use, and never out of order. I asked him to hang on, but this innocent man just rang off and set out to fly from his courtyard. I dialed his number in the directory trying to ring him back, but never got through.

Merciful God blessing, an abrupt freezing rainfall made his powder wet. Luckily, the trouble was without any extension except that he crashed into a greengrocer's making all the ripe fruits become messy jam. When people seized this crazy man with caution and sobered him by tapping his face, he complained about the bad weather instead of associating his failure with his unscientific design.

从法院人事部辞职后，我开始在现在的专利局工作。我工作起来既称职又有活力，在投身于根据新版的申请标准鉴定专利申请，以防它们无效或不实用时，我从未感觉到消极没劲。

为了显示与众不同，时不时就有人违反常规，向我们提交一些奇怪的产品申请，例如固定在前额的信号灯、立方体的胡桃、用稻草和胶水制作的冰箱、没人能受得了的香水等。

有一次，有个人用不锈钢丝和绳子制作了一架三角形的直升飞机。他致电给我们，高兴地声称其确实牢固，而且方便使用，从不发生故障。我请他稍等，但这个天真的人挂了电话就开始从院子里起飞。我拨打他在电话簿上的号码试图回电给他，却无法接通。

仁慈的上帝保佑，一场突然降临的冻雨打湿了他的火药，使他造成的麻烦没有扩大，只是撞入一间水果店，把所有成熟的水果都压成一塌糊涂的果酱。当人们小心地抓住这个失去理智的人，轻轻拍打他的脸使他清醒过来时，他还在抱怨糟糕的坏天气，却没有将他的失败与他不科学的设计联系起来。
